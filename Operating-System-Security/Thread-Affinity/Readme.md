Clone all the files into your local machine in a directory.

First try to see run the C program
/* ctest.c */
gcc -fPIC -o libctest.so -shared ctest.c

Second compile and run the java code
/* HelloWorld.java */

javac -classpath jna-4.0.0.jar HelloWorld.java
java -classpath jna-4.0.0.jar:. HelloWorld

Third program

There are few errors in the program. Yet to be fixed.
